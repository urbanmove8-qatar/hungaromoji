**The Definitive Open-Source Hungarian Emoji Engine**

Hungaromoji is a high-performance, non-intrusive JavaScript engine developed by the **Urbanmove 8** team.  
It is designed to modernize the visual experience of **PyQt/PySide, Qt, Electron, and web-based platforms** by replacing standard text emojis with custom, high-fidelity **Hungarian-themed assets**.

## 🛡️ Security & Transparency

Unlike “black box” closed-source software that demands personal data or ID verification, Hungaromoji is built on the core principles of **digital freedom**:

- **Fully Auditable:** Our code is 100% open-source and hosted on GitHub for public review.  
- **Privacy-Centric:** The script operates purely in the browser’s DOM. It does not collect personal data, track user behavior, or require government-issued identification.  
- **No System Interference:** Hungaromoji is a safe, front-end script. It does not touch system registries, kernel files, or external hardware.

## ✨ Features

- **Cultural Authenticity:** Supports unique Hungarian emojis, including the 100 HUF banknote, MÁV transport icons (Bzmot), and traditional book covers.  
- **Dynamic Real-Time Updates:** Utilizes a high-performance MutationObserver to automatically process new content without manual refreshes.  
- **Optimized Performance:** Uses WeakSet node tracking and regex pre-compilation to ensure zero lag and prevent layout thrashing.  
- **Historical Tribute:** Features an integrated tribute to the heroes of the 1956 Revolution, ensuring software remains a tool for remembrance and freedom.  
- **Fluid Layouts:** Inline images are CSS-optimized to scale perfectly with text typography (1.1em).
